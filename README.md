# Low_Light_Image_Enhancement
Deep Learning-Based Low Light Image Enhancement for Improved Visibility

## 🔍 Project Objective

Low-light images suffer from poor visibility, reduced contrast, and missing details, which makes them unusable in many real-world applications. This project aims to:

- Enhance low-light images automatically.
- Improve image contrast and detail preservation.
- Provide a tool useful for photography, surveillance, and medical imaging.
